# Preview Music Player Application README.md

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The components, images, and test audio in this app will be found in the src folder (/app/src)
This is also where the CSS, contexts, and the Firebase configuration file will be found.

Within the components folder, each component has been named appropriately, describing the component it represents.

App.js represents the top level of the application, where the routes are defined and loaded.

To run this locally - use npm start!
